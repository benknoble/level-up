# level-up

## About

If you haven't read the post that inspired this, go do that:
[http://jasonrudolph.com/blog/2011/08/09/programming-achievements-how-to-level-up-as-a-developer/](http://jasonrudolph.com/blog/2011/08/09/programming-achievements-how-to-level-up-as-a-developer/)

Now, there's a [gist attached to the article](https://gist.github.com/1133830)
that lets you fork and cross off which ones you've finished, as a sort of
self-tracking tool, but it seems to me that like many things,
*the journey is more important than the destination*.

Hence, this project.

You can see it in action [here](http://thenoviceoof.github.com/level-up/).

## Usage

 * fork this repo
 * enable github pages
 * change the first 5 lines of index.html
 * edit the files under `_posts/`
   * each file corresponds to a single entry (categories break up the sections)
   * the three states are `todo`, `wip`, and `done`

## Bugs

There will be bugs: if there are, please report them to:

    https://github.com/thenoviceoof/level-up/issues

Or fork and fix!
