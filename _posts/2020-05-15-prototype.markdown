I co-wrote [limchess](https://github.com/2buttonchess/limchess) with a friend of
mine for UNC Chapel Hill's Comp 580 (Enabling Technology). The project is mostly
JavaScript and leans heavily on jQuery to bring chess to the accessible world of
limited-input devices. (I haven't done anything with node, but I think this
still counts.)
