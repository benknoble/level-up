While at CapitalOne, I wrote a small language to generate necessary documents
for database migrations my team performed. I wrote a larger language that
combined general-purpose programming with a specific (HTTP/S) API to make
controlling Kafka clusters easier.

I wrote a Lisp interpreter in Java for UNC Chapel Hill's Comp 524 (Programming
Language Concepts). Previously, I wrote a compiler for a subset of Java (also in
Java) for Comp 520 (Compilers).

I have grander plans, though.
