I run weekly Git training at work involving 30-minute guided office hour-style
sessions and recorded shorts (5 minutes or less). I cover how to use various Git
tools, why they are important, how they are built. I also include social content
on open source stewardship, the importance of commit hygiene and best practices,
and PR reviews.
