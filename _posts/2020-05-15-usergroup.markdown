I presented [becoming a git
wizard](https://github.com/benknoble/git-wizard-content) to the Pearl Hacks 2020
Hackathon. It was my attempt to bring git to a beginner-friendly environment and
explore the core concepts (immutable trees of information, collaboration, etc.)
in a practical way.

I also gave my FUNARCH 2023 talk on GUI Easy to Amperity's Clojure meetup.
