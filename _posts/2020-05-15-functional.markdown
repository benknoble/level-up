During my time in a pilot for Principles of Programming, I built a git terminal
and web client in Clojure. The previous year, I wrote a
[simulator](https://github.com/benknoble/advent2019) for a type of computer
called ["Intcode"](https://adventofcode.com/2019) in Standard ML (in addition to
a bunch of other small programs).

I also built [loner](https://github.com/benknoble/loner), an LL(1) checker and
context-free-grammar library, in Scala.

I'm working on a formal-languages library and application in Clojure, and I have
a few more ideas for which SML or Haskell might be well-suited.

I recently wrote
[smlnj-parser-style](https://github.com/benknoble/smlnj-parser-style), a small
static-analysis library for UNC's Comp 524 (Programming Language Concepts).
