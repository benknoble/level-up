During my time in a pilot for Principles of Programming, I built a Git terminal
and web client in Clojure. The previous year, I wrote a
[simulator](https://github.com/benknoble/advent2019) for a type of computer
called ["Intcode"](https://adventofcode.com/2019) in Standard ML (in addition to
a bunch of other small programs).

I also built [loner](https://github.com/benknoble/loner), an LL(1) checker and
context-free-grammar library, in Scala.

I started on an incomplete [formal-languages library and application in
Clojure](https://github.com/benknoble/formallang), and I have a few more ideas
for which SML or Haskell might be well-suited.

I wrote [smlnj-parser-style](https://github.com/benknoble/smlnj-parser-style), a
small static-analysis library for UNC's Comp 524 (Programming Language
Concepts).

The [Frosthaven Manager](https://github.com/benknoble/frosthaven-manager) is a
large functional program thanks to [GUI
Easy](https://docs.racket-lang.org/gui-easy/index.html).
