[There it is](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/22320), my first "real"
open-source contribution. I had been lurking in the Roslyn team's commits and
issues for a while---at the time, I was very interested in the new C#
compiler---and I discovered and fixed an issue with the use of shell variables.
Veterans will likely recognize the quoting issue being resolved.
